# lacrimis_ex_machina
Python script to write a piece of music

This is an extremely simple attempt at composing a piece of music. The goal was an attempt to perform cellular subset navigation across ordinal references to scalar quantized pitch sets, imitating techniques and approaches by Morton Feldman, Philip Glass, Steve Reich, and Gerard Grisey, among others.

The title, Lacrimis Ex Machina, is intended to invoke the "lacrimis" falling fifths chord progression dominating the composition, and the "machina" of algorithmic pitch generation.

The script should be considered Work-In-Progress - bugs exist, and the piece is not complete (nor will exact notivic performance represent an ideal output of the composition in its current form).
